# Swift Best Practices ðŸ¦…

Follow Swift's [API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) whenever possible.

- Types start with uppercased letters. Functions, variables, and enums start with lowercased letters.
- Default to `struct` unless you need a class-only feature.
- Mark classes as `final` unless you want inheritance.
- Use `guard` to exit functions early.
- Avoid `self.` whenever possible.
