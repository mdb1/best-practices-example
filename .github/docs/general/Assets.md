# Assets ðŸŽ¨

We use asset catalogs to organize our applicationâ€™s assets.

## Colors
For Colors, we are using the exact hexadecimals from the Figma files and we are setting the display mode to `extended Range sRGB` in Xcode.

By doing this, we make sure we are using the exact same colors as the designers.

## Images
We use the same name for the file and the asset in Xcode for custom images.

We also try to always use SVG images, unless we have a reason to use other extension.
